# Neural networks

A collection of basic programs showing the usage and posibilites of machine learning.  
The exercises have been made as part of 'Neural Networks Programming' course in the 6th semester of technical Bachelor studies. Further English descriptions will be added in the future.  

The .venv folder has been automatically added by Visual Studio Code - it is not a part of my work on this project.
