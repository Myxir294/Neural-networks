I have used classes and tools from sklearn library.

The goal of the algorithrm is to predict share price of a chosen company on given day by analyzing trends from 5 days before. 

Optimization of learning parameters is made using GridSearchCV tool.

The result is provided as mean accuracy of prediction, in percents.

To do - improve results presentation, data shuffling
