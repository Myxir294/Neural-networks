# Perceptron/Adaline model classification task

The folder contains examples of using a neuron model to solve simple classification task.

During the exercise I have ussed classes from https://github.com/rasbt/pattern_classification/blob/master/machine_learning/singlelayer_neural_networks/singlelayer_neural_networks.ipynb

The goal of the task was to use the provided class to clasify flower species from Iris dataset.
Furthermore, I have provided a variant allowing to modify the used coefficients using Delta principle, with Adaline model.
